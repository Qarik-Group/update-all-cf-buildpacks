# Update all Cloud Foundry buildpacks

As a Cloud Foundry platform operator, I want to ensure my users/developers always have the latest upstream buildpacks, with the latest CVEs, for their applications.

```plain
# 1. cf login as an admin
# 2. run this script
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/starkandwayne/update-all-cf-buildpacks/master/update-only.sh | bash
```

## Data only

This project also curates a `buildpacks.json` file that contains the URLs for the latest buildpacks for each project:

```plain
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/starkandwayne/update-all-cf-buildpacks/master/buildpacks.json
```

## CI pipeline

The `update-only.sh` and `buildpacks.json` files are automatically updated via a CI pipeline:

* https://ci2.starkandwayne.com/teams/cfcommunity/pipelines/update-all-cf-buildpacks

The Concourse CI pipeline definition is in `ci/pipeline.yml`.
